## This module provides logging functionality for the project
## It sets up a logger that can be used across different modules
## The logger writes logs to a file and also outputs them to the console
## It includes different log levels such as INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, and ERROR
## The log format includes timestamps, log levels, and messages
## This helps in tracking the flow of execution and debugging issues
## for example, logging data loading steps, model training progress, and evaluation results

# Complete log file path
